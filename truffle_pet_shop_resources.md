Directory structureÂ¶

The default Truffle directory structure contains the following:

    contracts/: Contains the Solidity source files for our smart contracts. There is an important contract in here called Migrations.sol, which we'll talk about later.
    migrations/: Truffle uses a migration system to handle smart contract deployments. A migration is an additional special smart contract that keeps track of changes.
    test/: Contains both JavaScript and Solidity tests for our smart contracts
    truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file

    $.getJSON('Adoption.json', function(data) {
    // Get the necessary contract artifact file and instantiate it with @truffle/contract
    var AdoptionArtifact = data;
    App.contracts.Adoption = TruffleContract(AdoptionArtifact);

    // Set the provider for our contract
    App.contracts.Adoption.setProvider(App.web3Provider);

    // Use our contract to retrieve and mark the adopted pets
    return App.markAdopted();
    });

Open bs-config.json in a text editor (in the project's root directory) and examine the contents:

    {
        "server": {
            "baseDir": ["./src", "./build/contracts"]
        }
    }

This tells lite-server which files to include in our base directory. We add the ./src directory for our website files and ./build/contracts directory for the contract artifacts.
